# Utils

Shared utilities used across the training stack.

Files:
- `selection.py`: select values from dicts, tuples, or objects by key/index.
- `tree.py`: `tree_map` and `tree_flatten` for nested structures.
- `device.py`: device selection and tensor movement helpers.
- `seed.py`: global and dataloader worker seeding.
- `import_utils.py`: safe imports and filtered instantiation.
